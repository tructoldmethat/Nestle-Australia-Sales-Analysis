## Project Background
Nestlé has been a global leader in food and beverages for over 150 years, offering products such as dairy, confectionery, beverages, and prepared meals. As a data analyst at Nestlé Australia, I analyzed sales data for 9 Nestlé products from 2018 to 2020 to provide management with actionable insights to optimize operations, enhance decision-making, and capitalize on growth opportunities.

This analysis focuses on the following key areas:
- **Seasonality**: Examining month-over-month (MoM) and year-over-year (YoY) sales trends to identify demand fluctuations.
- **Dimensional Segmentation**: Analyzing sales by state, product, and sales medium to refine targeting strategies.
- **Distribution**: Identifying top-performing products and their contribution to overall revenue to guide resource allocation.
